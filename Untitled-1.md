Using the following figma mockup https://www.figma.com/design/k2010M59h2utK4pwqECoNp/Untitled?node-id=1-2&t=9tl6lCZ024qXXHQ7-11 use the figma dev MCP server to analyze the mockup and build the underlying code in this application. Use the recharts library for creating charts to make this a web application. Check how this application looks using the playwright MCP server and verify it looks as close to the mock as possible.
